# FPGA Guitar FX Board
This project uses an iCEBreaker FPGA (v1.1a) to create a fully modular guitar effects board. The board will take in audio input from a guitar and use digital signal processing to change the audio wave and create a differing output. The goal is to implement the following effects in such a way that they are also adjustable. 

1. Tone Creating pedals like distortion and overdrive
2. Tone Changing pedals like chorus, flangers, and phasers
3. Dynamics and Pitch Changing pedals like wahs, compressor, octave, and pitch shifters
4. Sound Repeating pedals like loops and delay
5. Ambiance pedals like reverb and noise gates
